# Why Choose Therapy?

Many people are discovering for themselves how therapy can be an effective and supportive way to release unwanted issues from the past which may have been unconsciously blocking their ability to flourish in the present.
To identify and connect with internal resources that will help them continue working towards their desired goals, and generally as a way to increase well-being, happiness and overall quality of life.

Therapy can help with untangling and resolving issues which may have become linked to:

 * low self-esteem,
 * anxiety,
 * depression,
 * addictions,
 * bereavement,
 * work-place stress,
 * eating-disorders,
 * relationship difficulties,
 * trauma.

Increasing self-awareness, improving emotional resilience and adaptability, which is certainly helpful during life transitions and other times of change. These are some of the valuable benefits of therapy.
